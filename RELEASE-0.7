- Cookbooks were refactored and hopefully improved.

Python Implementation
=====================

Low-level API
-------------

- Virtually all types of styles are supported in the limit of the current API.

- An API is available for searching and replacing patterns of text in a
  document.

- Basic shapes can be created: ellipse and circle, rectangle and square, and
  line.

- A basic API is available to add image, etc. files in documents, and
  reference them in e.g. image frames.

- A Virtual File System (VFS) layer handles grabbing document from HTTP and
  FTP.

- Tables are trying to automatically circumvent loading of big OOo tables of
  1024x65535 cells, even though the real content only makes 10x20 cells.

- After starting with the libxml2 Python wrapper, switched to lxml for both
  speed and ease of use.

High-level API
--------------

- The navigation API no longer use a context element. The element itself is
  the navigation API.

- Template are provided, with empty body, i.e. the ODT template has no
  paragraph, the ODS template has no table and the ODP template has no draw
  page.

- A document can grab styles from another document to merge them with its own
  ones.

- A specific API is available on paragraphs to insert notes and annotation.

- A specific API is available for table to work on them as a linear matrix,
  i.e. repetitions are expanded. Coordinate syntax like "C3" is supported.

- Tables can be created from and exported to CSV.

- The full API to metadata is available. Only RDF would be missing.

Command-line Utilities
----------------------

- The lpod-meta.py introspection tool can list and edit metadata of the
  document.

- The lpod-merge.py tool can merge documents of the same type. ODT, ODS and
  CSV and supported for now. ODP to come.

- The lpod-highlight.py tool can apply a style on a text pattern. The default
  style is overlining as if you were using a yellow highlighter pen.

- The lpod-mm2odt.py converts XML mind-map files to ODT.
