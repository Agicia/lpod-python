Documentation
=============

- Cookbooks illustrating the navigation API and the metadata API are now
  available.

Python Implementation
=====================

Low-level API
-------------

- Default numeric types were added, targeting the French locale for now.

- The text API is now richer.

High-level API
--------------

- Started to implement a templating language in the content of ODF documents.
  Only setting values and "if" are implemented for now, and only on text.

  You can see an example template in "python/templates/test_template.ott" and an
  example script in "python/templates/test_template.py".

  Templating the metadata is left as an exercise to the interested reader.

- Tables of content can now be filled with the titles found in the document.

- Draw page can use the fade transition.

Command-line Utilities
----------------------

- The lpod-show.py tool dumps a textual representation of the content. It can
  also dump the latter, style information and metadata list in a directory.

- The lpod-style.py introspection tool shows the list of styles of the
  document, wether it is used, and is able to remove them all. It can also
  merge styles from one document to another.

- The lpod-meta.py introspection tool can list and edit metadata of the
  document.

- The lpod-merge.py tool can merge documents of the same type. ODT, ODS and
  CSV and supported for now. ODP to come.

- The lpod-highlight.py tool can apply a style on a text pattern. The default
  style is overlining as if you were using a yellow highlighter pen.

- The lpod-mm2odt.py converts XML mind-map files to ODT.

Documentation
--------------

- 80% of the documentation if finish style missing:
xxx, xxx, xxx
