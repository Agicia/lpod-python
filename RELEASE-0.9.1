Low-level API
=============

- "get_style" and "get_style_list" callable from any element.
- "odf_container.get_contents" renamed to "get_parts"
- "odf_document.get_files" renamed to "get_parts"
- "odf_document.get_file_data" renamed to "get_part"

High-level API
==============

- To get a style by its display name, call::

    context.get_style(family, display_name=u"My Style")

  It was previously a boolean flag.

- In meta part, "(g|s)et_keyword" were renamed to "(g|s)et_keywords" to
  illustrate the possibility of assigning several keywords. ;-) But it still
  takes a single unicode string.

- In meta part, added "(g|s)et_comments" as an alias to "(g|s)et_description"
  because some desktop applications call them like this.
