Low-level API
=============

- The XML API in the odf_element class has seen many name shortenings:
  Before       After
  -----------  -----
  get_tagname  get_tag
  set_tagname  set_tag
- "odf_element.delete_element" now accepts no argument to delete itself as a
  shortcut.
- "odf_create_element" accepts qualified names such as "text:p" to quickly
  create a single element.

High-level API
==============

- Methods "get_heading_*" now get an "outline_level" argument instead of
  "level" for consistency and not to mix with attribute "text:level"
